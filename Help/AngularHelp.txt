Why Full Stack ?
Suppose you develop any ui ->Service(RestAPI) ->backend -> db  Full stack say if ui have to connect the IOT,or mobile app we can use 
th backend services as it . So in case of UI we are going to change the Angular or someother for the UI and rest of the things are the same .you can extend arctiecture 
and design of the applciation .

*ESScript ->EccmaScript is a standard and java script is the implimentation of ES.latest ver ES8(Modern JS usser modular programming).
** JS is loosely type lang means when u define variable you are not define type of the variable e.g var a,a=5 it is different from java which is tightly type when you define var you are 
    define the variable 
    value : number 
** TS you can define on parameter
      function add(number1:number,number2:num):number{
		return number1+number2;
	  }	
	  
	TS have concept of interface and class have to define the implimentation of interface 

Angular 
===============
			*to install npm install -g@angular/cli (here npm is like maven )
			*ng version 
			*npm install for node installation
			rules for lint are define in the tsLint.json 
			ng build -->crceate dist folder and help to deploy directly from this folder 
			ng test --> for test cases (Testcases written in jasmine and karma is used to run the test cases )
			  	|-Test cases file having specification .spec   test.ts is starting point of the testcases
			*ng e2e have protractor -->
			
			Framework and packages are mentioned in the package.json
			Pollyfills.ts take care of browser compatibility
			Style.css global style of the applciation
			app folder contain all the ng code like module components 
			assest contain the images 
			
			Interpolation
			
 Que1? how many file default generated when we add new Component ?
 Ans1: 4 files 
		index.component.html
		index.component.css
		index.component.ts
		index.component.spec.ts    //here we are saying that html page is loaded for specific data or event mentioned in the component.ts
		
Ques2:What is the module ?
Ans2 : A file having class and function .

Que3: how to make class public 
Ans3: by declaring export.

Ques4.Decorater ?
Ans4: is like object in the java 	@Component({
										selector:'app-welcome',
										templateUrl:'./welcome.component.html',
										styleUrs:['./welcome.component.css']
										})
										
Que5: method Declaration and variable?
Ans5:   ngOninit : void {}  here void is returntype 
	  var => varName ='' or ""  or in TS message:String="message" ,here String is optional 
	  
	(event)=WhatShouldYouDo
	
Que6 :What is struture of module ?
Ans6 :suppose by default App ,module is there that having Imports from 
	  then Decorator @Ngmodule({}) having all user define component for that module 
				|-then imports:[] //angular imports e.g BrowserModule,AppRoutingModule,FormsModule
				|-then provider:[]
				|-then bootstrap :[AppComponent] //When this component loaded which one loded first	
	  Export class AppModule  {}   and if outside this module component want outside this module then access by this export class 	

Que7:What happen on page load or Boostraping in the angular &RootModule &Component?
Ans7:When you load any page index.html loaded where you will find the name of rootmodule e.g app-route which one is loaded from main.ts
	  In the main.ts we define bootstrapModule (NameofModule) which one isloaded after getting the name of the module .Now in the App Module 
      Pick the name of the Bootstrap Component e.g AppComponent -> then app.component.TS->in then defination of Component ->Tempalte url->html page 
	  
      |-The Module which one is loaded first or bootstrap first called RootModule 
		to find open main.ts ->platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule){}	  
		
Que8:How to import css minified file ?
Ans8: @import url(link) --> in the style.css
Data binding 
		|-interpolitation one way {{}} create a variable that ties with the view 
		|-event binding onclick event (component event ) bind view event to the 
		|-2way [(ngModel)] from property to view and model 
		
Ques9: <a href="" > Vs <a routerLink=""> ?
Ans9:  when we click on the a href whole page is loaded which is not good practise so overcome this we use RouterLink 		
 		
Que10: Files generated while creating Service ?
Ans10: hardcoded-authentication.service.spec.ts (419 bytes)
       hardcoded-authentication.service.ts  		//*Something common for all components then go for Service 	

Routing 
  |-<router-outlet></router-outlet>
  |-route-> path and component  
  |-Dependency injected by addin router:Router in the constructor  and also have to do import
  |-in the logic called this,router.navigate method and display page &router also takes valueor or param form url
     e.g this.router.navigate(['welcome',this.username])	
  |-to call any object as a reference <a routerLink="/todos">Click here</a>	 

    <tr *ngFor="let todo of todos"> 	

  |- when you are routing and need param value in annother component this.route.snapshot.params['name'] and make sure 
      constructor(public route:ActivatedRoute) {}

    
*Something common for all components then go for Service
*@Injectable make that component available for DI.
*You can call Service directly in the html page without storing a value in variable and then calling (V33)
*For RouteGuard have to implements CanActivate  ->canActivate(route:ActivatedRouteSnapshot,state:RouterStateSnapshot){}
   |-so when we need that we need to implement extra on component or with service then go for RouteGuard 
   |Changes in the code in app routing.ts =>{path:'welcome/:name',component:WelcomeComponent,canActivate:[RouteGuardService]}, 
											{path:'todos',component:ListTodosComponent,canActivate:[RouteGuardService]},
											defining the canactivate component and service name
											
Vid 51-> 
 Observable
 ===========
 *Observable is used for asynchronous calls or we can say we are writing ajax code same like that ng uses observable .
 *Observable are declative have to define everything 
 TO CALL ANOTHER WEBSERVICE 
 =============================
 Step 1. Write a service and in constructor inject http:HttClient 
 Step 2. app.module import HTTPCLIENTMODULE
 Step 3.write method by using injected component variabe 
		 e.g this.http.get('http://localhost:8080/helloworld');
 Step 4. from where you are calling that service make sure you SUBSCRIBE that service       //Subscribe send asynchronous call means this one will not return the result
		  e.g this.welcomeDataService.executehelloWorldBeanService().subscribe();           //but it will be when synchronous call happen in JS
 Step 5. Sometime it will throw below Exception 
		   for that @CrossOrigin(origins="http://localhost:4200")
		 
 
 Que:Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/hello' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present    on the requested resource.
 Ans: means Eclipse server is not allowed to call 4200 server due to security so we have to define orgins with port no in the Controller class that means
	  allow these port to call 8080 api externally .	
	  @CrossOrigin(origins="http://localhost:4200")
    
 Ques:-SUBSCRIBE?
 Ans:-Subscribe send asynchronous call means this one will not return the result but it will be when synchronous call happen in JS
    	 e.g this.welcomeDataService.executehelloWorldBeanService().subscribe(); //not return result	
		 
		 this.welcomeDataService.executehelloWorldBeanService().subscribe(
          response => this.handleSuccessfulResponse(response)  
       );  
	   means needs to call the handleSuccessfulResponse,the response which comes back.You're saying when the subscribe whatever is done, by the observable is successful,
       get the response and call this specific method.
		 
 Que:Arrow Method?		
 Que:Error handling With SUBSCRIBE?
 Ans: To handle error or exception in ng one approach is with the subscribe first parameter as above we have successful return and second one is for error 

 Que: How to get param value from url ?
 Ans: BAck tick 
 
 Que: to get the value from URL Param ?
 Ans:   private route:ActivatedRoute) { }
		ngOnInit() {
			this.id=this.route.snapshot.params['id'];
			
Ques: ng =bind
Ans :  [(ngModel)]
		First one is property binding means [ngModel]="todo.Date" means date is binded for view and model 
      Second one is event binding when the specific model change update the value (ngModelChange)="todo.targetDate=$event"	
	  
Que: Why Form tag ?
Ans : when we need functionality like press Enter at any place on the page value should be submitted automatically 

Que: Template Variable in Angular ?
Ans: are used to do some validations  #todoForm="ngForm" also e.g required="required"	  
			
*ngFor	
*ngIf	
[(ngModel)] -> to use this import FormsModule from @angular/Forms in the app.module.ts	
navbar->when something represting navigation in bootstrap  have to include navbar 
Intercecptor => that we want to attach with evevry request 
PIPE=> what should done if req is success or fails 
==================================================Security=================================================================
 Spring boot strater security helps to secure web applcation and resful services .
 BAsic Authe -->Spring sec( form bassed Authentication default enabled by spring sec.)
	|-session cookie is set and session is set on server side so cookie will sent ith every request to the browser so if same browser all req are successfully
	 it is based on the session which is create on t	he server and cookie which is in your browser ,so this cookie identify 
	 the session in your browser and that would be used by authentication mechanism .
	  DisAdvantage --> need to create a session on the server side ***
	 
-Basic-> we have to send header with the user name password with every request .

Ques:-Error Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/users/sandeep/todos' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy:
 No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.	 
Sol:- Header is missing  means Authorization BAsic User name password

 Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8080/helloworld/ok' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
  Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status. ===========OPTIONS =RequestType
  
Intercecptor => that we want to attach with evevry request   

**Diadvantage of Basic Authentication is once user allowed there is no expiry of their credententials and not user tracking 
  to overcome this we have Custome Tokens  JWT (Json Web Tokens )
  JWT
  ====
  comnon tokens Standard and can contain user details and Authorization .
  *having standard part and other customized section which user can override as per their requirement .
  
  JWT Structure
  =============
  Header ,Payload , Signature
  Header => |-alg-what algorithm used for hashing 
			|-type:JWT
 
  Payload => predefined elements and are t not manadatory 
			|- sub 
			|-name 
			|-admin
			
  Signature => Base64 header header payload  and 532 bit secret (that make sure while decoding only that decoder knows this code )
