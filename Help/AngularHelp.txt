Angular

Why Full Stack ?
Suppose you develop any ui ->Service(RestAPI) ->backend -> db  Full stack say if ui have to connect the IOT,or mobile app we can use 
th backend services as it . So in case of UI we are going to change the Angular or someother for the UI and rest of the things are the same .you can extend arctiecture 
and design of the applciation .

*ESScript ->EccmaScript is a standard and java script is the implimentation of ES.latest ver ES8(Modern JS usser modular programming).
** JS is loosely type lang means when u define variable you are not define type of the variable e.g var a,a=5 it is different from java which is tightly type when you define var you are 
    define the variable 
    value : number 
** TS you can define on parameter
      function add(number1:number,number2:num):number{
		return number1+number2;
	  }	
	  
	TS have concept of interface and class have to define the implimentation of interface
