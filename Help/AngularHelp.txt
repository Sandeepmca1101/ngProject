Why Full Stack ?
Suppose you develop any ui ->Service(RestAPI) ->backend -> db  Full stack say if ui have to connect the IOT,or mobile app we can use 
th backend services as it . So in case of UI we are going to change the Angular or someother for the UI and rest of the things are the same .you can extend arctiecture 
and design of the applciation .

*ESScript ->EccmaScript is a standard and java script is the implimentation of ES.latest ver ES8(Modern JS usser modular programming).
** JS is loosely type lang means when u define variable you are not define type of the variable e.g var a,a=5 it is different from java which is tightly type when you define var you are 
    define the variable 
    value : number 
** TS you can define on parameter
      function add(number1:number,number2:num):number{
		return number1+number2;
	  }	
	  
	TS have concept of interface and class have to define the implimentation of interface 

Angular 
===============
			*to install npm install -g@angular/cli (here npm is like maven )
			*ng version 
			*npm install for node installation
			rules for lint are define in the tsLint.json 
			ng build -->crceate dist folder and help to deploy directly from this folder 
			ng test --> for test cases (Testcases written in jasmine and karma is used to run the test cases )
			  	|-Test cases file having specification .spec   test.ts is starting point of the testcases
			*ng e2e have protractor -->
			
			Framework and packages are mentioned in the package.json
			Pollyfills.ts take care of browser compatibility
			Style.css global style of the applciation
			app folder contain all the ng code like module components 
			assest contain the images 
			
			Interpolation
			
 Que1? how many file default generated when we add new Component ?
 Ans1: 4 files

										styleUrs:['./welcome.component.css']
										})
										
Que5: method Declaration and variable?
Ans5:   ngOninit : void {}  here void is returntype 
	  var => varName ='' or ""  or in TS message:String="messgae" ,here String is optional 
	  
	(event)=WhatShouldYouDo
	
Que6 :What is struture of module ?
Ans6 :suppose by default App ,odule is there that having Imports from 
	  then Decorator @Ngmodule({}) having all user define component for that module 
				|-then imports:[] //angular imports e.g BrowserModule,AppRoutingModule,FormsModule
				|-then provider:[]
				|-then bootstrap :[AppComponent] //When this component loaded which one loded first	
	  Export class AppModule  {}   and if outside this module component want outside this module then access by this export class 	

Que7:What happen on page load or Boostraping in the angular &RootModule &Component?
Ans7:When you load any page index.html loaded where you will find the name of rootmodule e.g app-route which one is loaded from main.ts
	  In the main.ts we define bootstrapModule (NameofModule) which one isloaded after getting the name of the module .Now in the App Module 
      Pick the name of the Bootstrap Component e.g AppComponent -> then app.component.TS->in then defination of Component ->Tempalte url->html page 
	  
      |-The Module which one is loaded first or bootstrap first called RootModule 
		to find open main.ts ->platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule){}	  
Que8:How to import css minified file ?
Ans8: @import url(link) --> in the style.css
Data binding 
		|-interpolitation one way {{}} create a variable that ties with the view 
		|-event binding onclick event (component event ) bind view event to the 
		|-2way [(ngModel)] from property to view and model 
 		
Routing 
  |-<router-outlet></router-outlet>
  |-route-> path and component  
  |-Dependency injected by addin router:Router in the constructor  and also have to do import
  |-in the logic called this,router.navigate method and display page &router also takes valueor or param form url
     e.g this.router.navigate(['welcome',this.username])	
  |-to call any object as a reference <a routerLink="/todos">Click here</a>	 

    <tr *ngFor="let todo of todos"> 	

  |- when you are routing and need param value in annother component this.route.snapshot.params['name'] and make sure 
      constructor(public route:ActivatedRoute) {}
